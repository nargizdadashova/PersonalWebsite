        I've traveled to England in 2023 , for summer school.We stayed in Queen Mary university in London for 2 weeks. London was everything I hoped for and more — a mix of old and new, busy streets and quiet corners, famous sights and little surprises around every turn. From spotting Big Ben in real life to stumbling upon cozy cafes and colorful markets, my trip was full of fun moments I can’t wait to share. In this post, I’ll tell you all about the places I visited and the little things that made me fall in love with this amazing city.

           I climbed St.Paul's Cathedral to see the breathtaking view of London from above.As I reached to the top , the city streched out in every direction-the Thames winding its way through gleaming skyscrapers and historic buildings alike.I stood there,taking it all in,feeling both small and incredibly alive at the same time.</p>

           Kensington Gardens – Where History Meets Nature
Nestled in the heart of London, Kensington Gardens offers a peaceful escape from the city's rush. It's a place where people come to relax, walk, and reconnect with nature. The park also acts as a semi-wild reserve, home to a variety of birds that live around its lakes and green spaces — a favorite spot for birdwatchers and families alike.
One of its highlights is the Princess Diana Memorial Playground, created to honor the late Princess of Wales.
Behind me in this photo is the majestic Albert Memorial, a tribute to Prince Albert, Queen Victoria’s beloved husband. The whole area is rich in history, beauty, and tranquility — a perfect blend of royal heritage and peaceful greenery.

        f this city were a color,it'd be light-brown.I visited Cambridge on rainy summer day , and I think that is exactly how it was supposed to be seen.The whole city had this quiet,timeless vibe.The buildings looked like they'veseen a lot-centuries of students,ideas.I wandered around without much of a plan—just following the streets, watching the punts on the river (even in the rain!), and peeking into cozy shops and cafes. Everything felt peaceful and smart in a low-key way.Cambridge isn’t showy, but that’s the whole charm. It’s the kind of place that leaves a quiet impression—like a favorite line in a book you keep thinking about later.I would love to visit this city once again.
